2. How much water runs off the roof?

IPO:

Input: get dimensions of the footprint of the rooftop in feet
Processing: convert dimensions to inches; then multiply them by inches of rainfall; then convert the result from cubic inches to gallons
Output: show amount of water that runs off a roof after a rain storm (in gallons)


Pseudocode:

Declare roof_length_in
Declare roof_width_in
Declare water_amount
Declare water_amount_gal

Prompt user for roof_length_ft
Get roof_length_ft
Prompt user for roof_width_ft
Get roof_width_ft
Prompt user for rainfall_in
Get rainfall_in

Calculate roof_length_in = roof_length_ft x 12
Calculate roof_width_in = roof_width_ft x 12

Calculate water_amount = roof_length_in x roof_width_in x rainfall_in
Calculate water_amount_gal = water_amount / 231

Display water_amount_gal
